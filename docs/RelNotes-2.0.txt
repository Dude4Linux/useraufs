v2.0 Release Notes
==================

* changed cli in a backwards incompatible way (reason for major new version)
Previously:
	mount [ -options ] <branch>[:<branch> ...] <mount-path>
	remount <operation>[,<operation> ...] <mount-path>

Now:
	mount [ -options ] <mount-path> <branch> [<branch> ...]
	remount <mount-path> [<operation> ...]

* bugfix: remount works without operations now

* implemented workaround to allow branches with ':' in them

  GOTCHA: If a mount-path has a ':' in it, it works, but registers an error
	  (due to a mount.aufs bug)
