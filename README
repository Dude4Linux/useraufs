Giving users the privilege to perform unrestricted aufs operations
(e.g., using sudo) is a big security risk, as union mounts can be
exploited to arbitrarily restructure the filesystem as part of a
privilege escalation attack.

So I wrote a suid-root user interface called useraufs that allows safe
user-level aufs operations. Prior to that I hardened pyproject's
execution proxy to more securely support setuid root applications.

The basic principle is that users can safely perform aufs operations
on any directory which they own.

An HRA systems-level detail is that useraufs explicitly disallows root
from using it. To enable useraufs to operate under MAC, we need to
grant it integrity threatening capabilities such as
CAP_SYS_ADMIN. This is a capability that root does not have under the
default HRA policy. If we allowed useraufs to be run by root, and
operate on root owned directories, it could be used by an attacker
that has compromised root access to circumvent the default policy and
compromise system integrity.

useraufs is a bit easier to use than vanilla aufs options through the
mount commands. For the time being, it does not support the full
breadth of aufs options since I don't see a need for them right now.

Syntax: useraufs <command> [args]
